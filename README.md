# 🎨 Color Matcher

**Color Matcher** is an interactive browser-based game that challenges your eye for color and your ability to distinguish subtle hue variations. Built in pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the game draws from an extensive palette of over **700 historically and artistically significant colors** — from *Tyrian Purple* to *Verdigris*, *Lead White*, and *Carmine*.

Each round presents a new set of colors. Players must match the target color by name as quickly and accurately as possible. As rounds progress, the differences between colors become more nuanced, testing both visual precision and memory.

## 🧩 Gameplay

- Each round displays **one target color** and **twelve possible choices**.  
- Select the color name that best matches the target.  
- Correct answers advance you to the next round; incorrect guesses cost you a life.  
- The game continues through **30 progressively challenging rounds**.

## 🎨 Color Dataset

The color library is drawn from:

- **Historic pigments** (e.g., *Minium*, *Orpiment*, *Vermilion*)  
- **Natural dyes and minerals** (e.g., *Woad*, *Cochineal*, *Madder*)  
- **Cultural palettes** (e.g., *Byzantine*, *Tyrian Purple*, *Dutch Orange*)  
- **Modern color systems** (CSS and extended hexadecimal standards)

This creates one of the most comprehensive artistic color lists in any web-based matching game.

## 🧠 Inspiration

The project began in response to my poetry reading, John Milton would often reference colors, and I had no idea which color he had in mind, so I wanted to create a game to help me understand colors, their names, and their distinctions.
